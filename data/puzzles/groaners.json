Solution for #10
They were two of triplets.

Solution for #11
The only place each window could have a southern exposure is on the north pole. So the bear must have been a polar bear. The answer, therefore, is white.

Solution for #18
One. Everybody else was coming from St. Ives.

I don't. In 46 B.C., they wouldn't have known how many years before Christ it was.

Solution for #28

Solution for #29

Solution for #30

Solution for #39

Solution for #40

Solution for #41
The sun never rises and sets at the same time of day. Except at the poles, the sun only rises in the morning and only sets in the evening. Even at the poles, it can't do both simultaneously.

Solution for #42
"Language." Ignore the first two sentences, which are irrelevant to the question. The third sentence says, "There are three words in 'the English language.'" The first is "the"; the second is "English"; and the third is "language." Language is something we use every day.

Unfortunately, this puzzle is frequently asked of others by those who do not know the answer; as such, the wording of the puzzle is inadvertently altered in such a way that there is no correct answer. There are a couple other archaic words in English that end in "gry"; however, none of these are correct answers, because none of them are things we use every day. (Besides, then the puzzle would be a trivia question rather than a riddle.)

Solution for #43
None. Roosters do not lay eggs.

Solution for #44
George.

Solution for #45
Second.

Solution for #46
They're all boys. Half are boys, and so is the other half.

Solution for #47
12

Solution for #48
They will never be under water. The ship will rise with the tide.

Solution for #49
Alternate Solution #1

Half a trunk full of dimes. Dimes are worth twice as much, so half the number of dimes as nickels would be worth the same amount. But since dimes are smaller than nickels, more dimes than nickels can fit in the same amount of space.

Alternate Solution #2

Depends on whether the trunk was cut in half horizontally or vertically. Vertically, you couldn't carry many dimes in it, so the whole trunk full of nickels is probably the better bet.

Solution for #50
Eight: seven sisters and one brother.

Solution for #51
The current President, still in office.

Solution for #52
Any number of times. 21 minus 2 is 19, every single time.
