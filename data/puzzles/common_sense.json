#1
Suppose you are on an elevator on the 16th floor of a building, when the cable breaks. As you plummet toward the ground, you recall that you once heard that by jumping up fast at the instant of impact, you can escape death. You also recall that the floors are twelve feet apart and that the acceleration of a falling object is 32 feet per second squared. When should you jump?

Solution for #1
You would impact between the 2nd and 3rd second after the cable broke, so you would want to jump 2 seconds after the break. However, considering the calculations involved, you would probably end up as a heap of screaming bloody mess at the bottom of the elevator shaft before you figured the answer out. Besides, there's no telling if jumping really works.

Solution for #2
About half way. After that, he starts running out of the woods.

Solution for #3
From now until hell freezes over. No telescope yet invented has that kind of magnification. Besides, Alpha Centuri is a star and your friend couldn't get within miles of it without being vaporized.

Solution for #4
Far enough.

Solution for #5
Pretty good! The dice are obviously loaded.

Solution for #6
Apply a tourniquet, and you won't.

Solution for #7
As many as you can carry, if they aren't in dollar-based currencies.

Solution for #8
Who cares? I want to see how that half a boy can eat anything.
