Isaac and Albert were excitedly describing the result of the Third Annual International Science Fair Extravaganza in Sweden. There were three contestants, Louis, Rene, and Johannes. Isaac reported that Louis won the fair, while Rene came in second. Albert, on the other hand, reported that Johannes won the fair, while Louis came in second.

In fact, neither Isaac nor Albert had given a correct report of the results of the science fair. Each of them had given one correct statement and one false statement. What was the actual placing of the three contestants?

Travelling to a city, an old man lost his way. He came to a fork in the road and did not know which road to take. Standing at the fork were two men. Next to the men was a sign, which you may assume is correct, which stated that one of the two men always told the truth and one of the men always told lies (but it was not known which was which). The sign went on to say that travellers could only ask one of the men one question.

What question could the old man pose that would give him the information he needs to choose the correct route?

Three men stay at a hotel for the night. The innkeeper charges thirty dollars per room per night. The men rent one room; each pays ten dollars. The bellhop leads the men to their room. Later, the innkeeper discovers he has overcharged the men and asks the bellhop to return five dollars to them. On the way upstairs, the bellhop realizes that five dollars can't be evenly split among three men, so he decides to keep two dollars for himself and return one dollar to each man.

At this point, the men have paid nine dollars each, totalling 27. The bellhop has two, which adds up to 29. Where did the thirtieth dollar go?

Three men, members of a safari, are captured by cannibals in the jungle. The men are given one chance to escape with their lives. The men are lined up and bound to stakes such that one man can see the backs of the other two, the middle man can see the back of the front man, and the front man can't see anybody. The men are shown five hats, three of which are black and two of which are white. Then the men are blindfolded, and one of the five hats is placed on each man's head. The remaining two hats are hidden away. The blindfolds are removed. The men are told that if just one of the men can guess what hat he's wearing, they may all go free. Time passes. Finally, the front man, who can't see anyone, correctly guesses the color of his hat. What color was it, and how did he guess correctly?

A gambler bet on a horse race, but the bookee wouldn't tell him the results of the race. The bookee gave clues as to how the five horses finished -- which may have included some ties -- and wouldn't pay the gambler off unless the gambler could determine how the five horses finished based on the following clues:

Penuche Fudge finished before Near Miss and after Whispered Promises.
Whispered Promises tied with Penuche Fudge if and only if Happy Go Lucky did not tie with Skipper's Gal.
Penuche Fudge finished as many places after Skipper's Gal as Skipper's Gal finished after Whispered Promises if and only if Whispered Promises finished before Near Miss.
The gambler thought for a moment, then answered correctly. How did the five horses finish the race?

A computer cable has seven connectors, arranged in a perfect circle -- so by rotating the plug, it can be connected to the outlet in any of seven different ways. Each of the connectors is numbered from one to seven, each number being used exactly once. The same is true for the holes in the outlet. The device that uses this cable only requires that one of the connectors match up to its corresponding hole in order to operate. How should you number the connectors on the plug and the holes in the outlet so that, no matter how the cable is rotated and plugged in, at least one connector matches up?

Five men and five dogs (each man owned a dog) went hiking. They encountered a river that was swift and deep. The only way to cross it was an abandoned boat, left ashore on their side. But it would only hold three living things. Unfortunately, the dogs were edgy and could not be near another person (not even momentarily) unless its owner was present. One of the dogs attended a highly advanced, highly specialized obedience school and therefore knew how to operate the boat -- the other dogs lack this skill. How did the five men and the five dogs cross the river?

Four intellectuals are lined up so that each intellectual can see the ones in front of him but not the ones behind him. (The back one can see the other three, and the front one can't see anybody.) One hat is placed on the heads of each of the intellectuals. (None of them may see the color of their own hat, but each may see the color of the hats on the intellectuals in front of him.) Each of the four hats are one of three different colors (red, white, and blue), and there is at least one hat of each color (so there's one duplicate). Each of the intellectuals, starting with the back and ending with the front, is asked the color of the hat he is wearing. Each of the intellectuals is able to deduce and give a correct answer out loud, in turn. What arrangement of the hats permits this to be possible without guessing (since the specific colors chosen are arbitrary, just indicate which two intellectuals must be wearing hats of the same color), and how did they do it?

Assuming a perfectly spherical Earth, somewhere one mile north of the latitude (in the southern hemisphere) that is one mile in circumference. The man walks south one mile to this latitude and walks one mile east, which takes him all the way around and back to where he started. The last step (one mile north) retraces the first step he took (one mile south).

Alternate Solution #2

The man could also be one mile north of the latitude that is one half mile in circumference -- on second leg of the journey, he'd go around twice instead of once. He could also be one mile north of the latitude that is one third of a mile in circumference, or one mile north of the latitude that is one quarter of a mile in circumference, and so on.

Take a piece of fruit from the box marked "apples and oranges." Suppose the fruit you take is an apple. Then that box must be the box containing just apples. Therefore, the box marked "oranges" can't be the box containing just apples, and it can't be the box containing just oranges either -- so it must be the box containing apples and oranges. The remaining box is therefore the box containing just oranges.

If the fruit you take out is an orange, the solution is derived in a similar fashion: the box marked "apples and oranges" is the box containing just oranges; the box marked "apples" is the box containing both apples and oranges; and the box marked "oranges" is the one containing just apples.

To get seven gallons, fill the five gallon jug and dump what you can into the three gallon jug, filling it. There are now two gallons in the five gallon jug. Dump out the three gallon jug, and put the two gallons from the five gallon jug into the three gallon jug. Then fill the five gallon jug. The total is seven gallons.

To get four gallons, fill the three gallon jug, and dump it into the five gallon jug. Fill the three gallon jug again, and dump what you can into the five gallon jug. Now there is one gallon in the three gallon jug. Dump out the five gallon jug, and put the one gallon from the three gallon jug into the five gallon jug. Now fill the three gallon jug. The total is four gallons.

Solution for #13
Remember that the host knows where the prize is. When you pick a door, there's a 66.7% chance you're wrong. If you're wrong, the host will always open the one door left that doesn't contain the prize. So if you were wrong (66.7% chance), you're better off switching to the door that the host leaves closed.

What you are really being asked here is whether the odds are better with your first choice, or with both of the other two. All the host really does is prove that it isn't in one of the remaining two -- but we knew that anyway, because there's only one prize.

Another way to look at it is this: consider that there are 1000 doors. You pick one. Before you open it, the host opens 998 of the 999 remaining doors. There's a 0.1% chance you guessed correctly -- if you guessed wrong (99.9% chance), then you know the prize is in the one door the host left shut. So you're better off changing your guess.

Still not convinced? This is Brain Food's most contested answer, but it is correct! Let's break it down a little more explicitly:

There are nine possible scenarios:

Prize is behind door A. You pick door A.
Prize is behind door A. You pick door B.
Prize is behind door A. You pick door C.
Prize is behind door B. You pick door A.
Prize is behind door B. You pick door B.
Prize is behind door B. You pick door C.
Prize is behind door C. You pick door A.
Prize is behind door C. You pick door B.
Prize is behind door C. You pick door C.
Now the host, who knows which door the prize is behind, deliberately chooses a door that the prize is not behind. For the three cases where you chose correctly in the beginning, the host has the choice of which other door to open. It doesn't matter which one he picks. But for the six cases where you chose wrong, he deliberately chooses the wrong guess of the remaining two choices, revealing it to be a wrong guess. It all breaks down as follows:

Prize is behind door A. You pick door A. Host reveals door B or C as empty.
Prize is behind door A. You pick door B. Host reveals door C as empty.
Prize is behind door A. You pick door C. Host reveals door B as empty.
Prize is behind door B. You pick door A. Host reveals door C as empty.
Prize is behind door B. You pick door B. Host reveals door A or C as empty.
Prize is behind door B. You pick door C. Host reveals door A as empty.
Prize is behind door C. You pick door A. Host reveals door B as empty.
Prize is behind door C. You pick door B. Host reveals door A as empty.
Prize is behind door C. You pick door C. Host reveals door A or B as empty.
(We've had several complaints that the above listing is incorrect because scenarios 1, 5, and 9 should be broken out. In fact, it is incorrect to break them out, because what's important here is that each listed scenario have an equal probability of occurring, not that each scenario be broken down to irreducible terms.)

Now we come to the point where we must decide whether to stick to the original guess or to switch:

Prize is behind door A. You pick door A. Host reveals door B or C as empty. Switching loses.
Prize is behind door A. You pick door B. Host reveals door C as empty. Switching wins.
Prize is behind door A. You pick door C. Host reveals door B as empty. Switching wins.
Prize is behind door B. You pick door A. Host reveals door C as empty. Switching wins.
Prize is behind door B. You pick door B. Host reveals door A or C as empty. Switching loses.
Prize is behind door B. You pick door C. Host reveals door A as empty. Switching wins.
Prize is behind door C. You pick door A. Host reveals door B as empty. Switching wins.
Prize is behind door C. You pick door B. Host reveals door A as empty. Switching wins.
Prize is behind door C. You pick door C. Host reveals door A or B as empty. Switching loses.
Final conclusion: switching wins six out of nine times, which is equal to two thirds of the time, or about 66.7%.

Two. Weigh three of the doughnuts against three others and leave the remaining two on the table. If the scales are even, the heavy doughnut is one of the two on the table -- weigh them to find out. If the scales are uneven, take the three doughnuts on the heavy end, weigh one of them against another, and leave the third on the table. If the scales are uneven, you've found the heavy one. If not, the heavy one is the one on the table.

Solution for #18
The back man can see the hats worn by the two men in front of him. So, if both of those hats were white, he would know that the hat he wore was black. But, since he doesn't answer, he must see at least one black hat ahead of him.

After it becomes apparent to the middle man that the back man can't figure out what he's wearing, he knows that there is at least one black hat worn by himself and the front man. Knowing this, if the middle man saw a white hat in front of him, he'd know that his own hat was black, and could answer the question correctly. But, since he doesn't answer, he must see a black hat on the front man.

After it becomes apparent to the front man that neither of the men behind him can answer the question, he realizes the middle man saw a black hat in front of him. So he says, correctly, "My hat is black."

Solution for #20
Start with the assumption that everybody knows their own spouses -- which means that everybody there knew at least one person. Discounting yourself, everyone knows a different number of people, which means that (again, discounting yourself) one person knows one, one person knows two, one person knows three, etc., up to one person who knows nine people (everybody else). Number the people (besides yourself) according to how many people they know, so that person 1 is the one who knows one person, person 2 is the one who knows two people, etc.

Now pair up people with their spouses. If person 9 knows everybody else, s/he must be the only person who knows person 1, because person 1 only knows one person. So they must be married. Person 8 knows everybody except for person 1. Person 2 therefore knows person 8 and person 9. Person 9 is married to person 1, so person 2's spouse must be person 8. Person 7 knows everybody except for persons 1 and 2. Person 3 therefore knows persons 7, 8, and 9. Persons 8 and 9 are married to persons 2 and 1 respectively, so person 3's spouse must be person 7. Person 6 knows everybody except for persons 1, 2, and 3. Person 4 therefore knows persons 6, 7, 8, and 9. The only one of those not yet paired up is person 6, so person 4 and person 6 must be married.

This leaves person 5, who knows everyone except persons 1, 2, 3, and 4. These five people, therefore, must be persons 6, 7, 8, 9, and you. Since you are the only one of these five not yet paired up, person 5 must be your spouse. So your spouse knew five people prior to the party.

The above also determines that the people who know you are persons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. So you knew five people prior to the party also.

Fill the 8 liter jug with the 12 liter jug, leaving 4 liters remaining. Fill the 5 liter jug with the 8 liter jug, leaving 3 liters remaining. Empty the 5 liter jug into the 12 liter jug. Now there are 9 liters in the 12 liter jug and 3 liters in the 8 liter jug. Pour the 3 liters from the 8 liter jug into the 5 liter jug. Now fill the 8 liter jug with water from the 12 liter jug, leaving 1 liter in the 12 liter jug. Fill the 5 liter jug (which already has 3 liters in it) from the 8 liter jug, leaving 6 liters in the 8 liter jug. Empty the 5 liter jug into the 12 liter jug. Now there are 6 liters in the 12 liter jug, 6 liters in the 8 liter jug, and the 5 liter jug is empty.

This is a tongue twister of an explanation, but bear with me.

The shortest of the tallest people in each row will be taller than, or the same height as, the tallest of the shortest people in each column. There are four cases. The first is that the shortest of the tallest and the tallest of the shortest are the same person, so obviously in this case the shortest of the tallest and the tallest of the shortest would be the same height.

The second case is that the shortest of the tallest and the tallest of the shortest are in the same row. The shortest of the tallest people in each row is obviously the tallest person in his row, so he's taller than the tallest of the shortest, who is also in his row.

The third case is that the shortest of the tallest and the tallest of the shortest are in the same column. The tallest of the shortest people in each column is obviously the shortest person in his row, so he's shorter than the shortest of the tallest, who is also in his column.

The fourth case is that the shortest of the tallest is neither in the same column nor the same row as the tallest of the shortest. For this case, consider the person X who is standing in the intersection of the row containing the shortest of the tallest and the column containing the tallest of the shortest. X must be taller than the tallest of the shortest, since the tallest of the shortest is the shortest in his column, and X must also be shorter than the shortest of the tallest, since the shortest of the tallest is the tallest in his row. So TofS < X < SofT.

So the shortest of the tallest in each row is always taller than, or the same height as, the tallest of the shortest in each column.

Let the five men be represented by A, B, C, D, and E. Let the five dogs be represented by a, b, c, d, and e. Let the dog that can operate the boat be dog a.

a, b, and c cross the river. a comes back alone and takes back d. a goes back and says behind while B, C, and D cross the river. Now A, a, E, and e are on the starting shore, and B, b, C, c, D, and d are on the destination shore. D and d return; A and a cross. C and c go back, and C, D, and E cross. Now dogs c, d, and e are on the starting shore, and everyone else is on the destination shore. a goes back and returns with c and d, then goes back and returns with e.

Solution for #30
Pick one of the men and ask, "If I were to ask you whether the left fork leads to where I'm going, and you chose to answer that question with the same degree of truth as you answer this question, would you then answer 'yes'?"

The truthteller will say "yes" if the left fork leads to where you're going and "no" otherwise. The liar will answer the same, since he will lie about where the left fork leads, and he will lie about lying. The third man may either lie or tell the truth about this one question, but either way he is behaving like either the truthteller or the liar and thus must correctly report the road to your destination.

Solution for #31
Three birds were seen by one person each, three were seen by each unique pair (Abel-Mabel, Abel-Caleb, and Mabel-Caleb), and one was seen by all three. So seven birds were seen in all, and each person saw a total of four. Hence, all of the birds Caleb saw were yellow. These four birds are: (1) the one Caleb saw alone, (2) the one Caleb saw with Abel, (3) the one Caleb saw with Mabel, and (4) the one all three saw together. This accounts for both of the yellow birds Abel saw, and two of the three yellow birds Mabel saw. The third yellow bird Mabel saw could not have been the one Abel and Mabel saw together, because Abel only saw two yellow birds; so the third yellow bird Mabel saw must have been the one she saw alone.

So five yellow birds were seen (the one Mabel saw, the one Caleb saw, the one Abel and Caleb saw, the one Mabel and Caleb saw, and the one all three saw), and two non-yellow birds were seen (the one Abel saw and the one Abel and Mabel saw) by the group.

Solution for #34
The problem is solved by assuming positions for the ace, determining what the order for the first shuffle would be based on those assumptions, until one such assumption does not produce a conflict. Consider:

Initial Order	A	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	J	Q	K
Second Shuffle Order	10	9	Q	8	K	3	4	A	5	J	6	2	7
We will first assume the ace was in the second slot after the first shuffle. So the shuffling algorithm would always place the card in the first slot into the second slot. Therefore, the 9 must have been the first card after the first shuffle, or it couldn't have ended up as the second card after the second shuffle.

Now that we know that the 9 must have been the first card after the first shuffle, we know that the shuffling algorithm takes the card in the ninth slot and puts it into the first slot. So after the first shuffle, the 10 must have been in the ninth slot, or the 10 would never have ended up as the first card after the second shuffle.

We follow this logic pattern until our knowledge of the order of the cards after the first shuffle is complete. It turns out that this is the correct answer. If we assume the ace to be in any other position other than the second, then we will eventually encounter a contradiction, where two cards must go into the same slot.

So the final ordering is: 9, A, 4, Q, J, 7, 3, 2, 10, 5, K, 8, 6.

Solution for #35
The father is 40, and the son is 10.

Solution for #36
The two intellectuals in front must be wearing hats of the same color. Let's suppose the front two were wearing red hats, the third was wearing a white hat, and the fourth (in back) was wearing a blue hat. The intellectual in back must be the first to answer. If he saw one hat of each color on the three intellectuals in front of him, he would not be able to guess the color of his own hat, since the duplicate color could be any of them. Therefore, he must see two hats of the same color (red) and one hat of a second color (white), and he can state conclusively that he must be wearing the hat of the third color (blue).

Since the back person can say what color hat he's wearing, the other intellectuals must realize that no one else is wearing a hat of that color. So each of the others can narrow down the color of their own hats to the remaining two colors.

The next intellectual knows his hat isn't blue, and he knows there is only one hat that's blue. If he saw a hat of each of the two remaining colors on the two intellectuals in front of him, he wouldn't be able to determine the color of his own hat, since the duplicate color could be either of them. He must, therefore, see two hats of the same color (red), and can conclude that his own hat is of the color he does not see (white).

The next intellectual realizes that the only way the two intellectuals behind him could guess the colors of their hats would be if he and the front intellectual were wearing hats of the same color. He sees the color of the front intellectual's hat (red) and states that this is the color of his.

The front intellectual realizes this too and repeats the color stated by the intellectual behind him.

Solution for #37
1 sees 2 and 3. If 1 saw two black hats or two white hats, then he would be able to guess the color of his hat. But in this case, he doesn't -- he sees a white hat and a black hat. Some time passes, and 2 realizes that 1 is not sure what color hat he's wearing. The only way 1 wouldn't be sure is if 2 and 3 are wearing differently colored hats. 2, who sees what color hat 3 is wearing (black), correctly names the opposite color as the color of his own hat.

There are six possible scenarios. Let's call the first man A, the second man B, and the third man C. The six scenarios, then, are:

Scenario	A	B	C
I	Truthteller	Liar	Random Man
II	Truthteller	Random Man	Liar
III	Liar	Truthteller	Random Man
IV	Liar	Random Man	Truthteller
V	Random Man	Truthteller	Liar
VI	Random Man	Liar	Truthteller
Follow these steps to determine which possibility listed above is correct:

Ask A, "Is B more likely to tell the truth than C?"
If yes, go to step 2.
If no, go to step 5.
Ask C, "Are you the random man?"
If yes, go to step 3.
If no, go to step 4.
Ask C, "Is A the truthteller?"
If yes, then scenario V is the case.
If no, then scenario II is the case.
Ask C, "Is A the liar?"
If yes, then scenario IV is the case.
If no, then scenario VI is the case.
Ask B, "Are you the random man?"
If yes, go to step 6.
If no, go to step 7.
Ask B, "Is A the truthteller?"
If yes, then scenario VI is the case.
If no, then scenario I is the case.
Ask B, "Is A the liar?"
If yes, then scenario III is the case.
If no, then scenario V is the case.
By following the steps above, you will only ever ask three questions in all, and the answers will determine the identities of the three men.

Solution for #43
The problem can be solved in three weighings.

Weigh four marbles against four others, leaving four on the table.
If both sides are equal, all eight marbles on the scale can be eliminated. Put three of the four from the table onto one side and three from the eliminated batch on the other.
If both sides are equal, the odd marble is the last one; weigh it with any other marble to see if it's heavier or lighter.
If the side with the marbles still under consideration moves up or down, weigh one of those three marbles against one of the others, and the third marble is set aside.
If both sides are equal, the third marble is the odd one, and it is heavier or lighter depending on whether or not the scales moved down or up in the previous weighing.
If the scales move, the odd marble is the one that moves in the same direction that the three marbles under consideration moved in the previous weighing. If it moves up, it's lighter; if it moves down, it's heavier.
If the scales move, take one marble from each side and switch them. One one side only, remove the other three and set them aside for later. Replace them with three marbles from the four left on the table (now known not to be the odd one).
If the two sides are equal, the odd marble is among the three set aside. Weigh one against another, and set the third aside.
If the sides are equal, the odd marble is the third one, and it is heavier or lighter depending on which way the scales moved in the first weighing.
If the scales move, the odd marble is the one that moved in the same direction as it did in the first weighing, and it is heavier or lighter depending on whether it went down or up.
If the two sides move in different directions as in the first weighing, the odd marble is one of the two that switched places. Weigh one of the two against any of the other ten.
If both sides are equal, the odd marble is the one left out. It's heavier or lighter depending on which way the scales moved in the second weighing.
If the scales move, the marble on the scales that's under consideration is the odd one, and it is heavier or lighter depending on whether it went down or up.
If the two sides move in the same direction as in the first weighing, the odd marble is one of the three that hadn't moved from its side. Weigh one of the three against another, and set the third aside.
If the sides are equal, the odd marble is the third one, and it is heavier or lighter depending on which way the scales moved in the previous weighings.
If the scales move, the odd marble is the one that moved in the same direction as it did in the previous weighings, and it is heavier or lighter depending on whether it went down or up.

Light one fuse at both ends and, at the same time, light the second fuse at one end. When the first fuse has completely burned, you know that a half hour has elapsed, and, more relevantly, that the second fuse has a half hour left to go. At this time, light the second fuse from the other end. This will cause it to burn out in 15 more minutes. At that point, exactly 45 minutes will have elapsed.

Fill the three-gallon tank from the eight-gallon. Dump the three-gallon tank into the five-gallon. Fill the three-gallon tank from the eight-gallon again and use that to fill the five-gallon. Now you've got two gallons in the eight-gallon tank, five gallons in the five-gallon tank, and one gallon in the three-gallon tank.

Dump the five-gallon tank into the eight-gallon tank. Put the gallon from the three-gallon tank into the five-gallon tank. Now you've got seven gallons in the eight-gallon tank and one in the five-gallon tank.

Fill the three-gallon tank from the eight-gallon tank. Dump the three-gallon tank into the five-gallon tank. You should now have four gallons in the eight-gallon tank and four gallons in the five-gallon tank.

Alternate Solution #2

Fill the five-gallon tank from the eight-gallon. Fill the three-gallon tank from the five-gallon. Pour the three-gallon tank back into the eight-gallon tank. Now you should have six gallons in the eight-gallon tank and two gallons in the five-gallon tank.

Dump the two gallons in the five-gallon tank into the three-gallon tank. Pour what you can from the eight-gallon tank into the five-gallon tank. Now you should have one gallon in the eight-gallon tank, five gallons in the five-gallon tank, and two gallons in the three-gallon tank.

Top off the three-gallon tank from the five-gallon, and dump the three-gallon tank into the eight-gallon tank.

Suzy's birthday must be on December 31 of some year. Let's say she was born on December 31, 2000. That means Suzy's ninth birthday is December 31, 2009. And let's say "today" is January 1, 2010.

If we suppose these things, then two days earlier would be December 30, 2009, the day before Suzy's ninth birthday. She was 8.

Now let's get back to today's date, January 1, 2010. "Next year" is 2011. On January 1, 2011, she'll only be 10, but on December 31 that same year, she'll be 11.

Yes. No matter how he varies his travel speed within the two trips, there must indeed be such a point somewhere along the path. An easy way to visualize this is to imagine, instead of one man making one trip and then making the return trip, two men making the trip at the same time. One man leaves the bottom at 1pm and heads toward the top. The other leaves the top at 1pm and heads toward the bottom. Regardless of their rate of travel over the course of the trip, they must pass each other on their respective journeys -- or, in other words, that at some point they must be at the same place at the same time.
